# gatsby-starter-hello-world
Starter with the bare essentials needed for a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site.

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

Or [view the live demo here](https://gatsby-starter-hello-world-demo.netlify.com/).


## Powershell -> gatsby develop

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#create-a-gatsby-site

You’ll be able to visit the site locally at http://localhost:8000 for as long as your development server is running. That’s the process you started by running the gatsby develop command. To stop running that process (or to “stop running the development server”), go back to your terminal window, hold down the “control” key, and then hit “c” (ctrl-c). To start it again, run gatsby develop again!


## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
ctrl+C to disable
